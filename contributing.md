# Contributing to Moss

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Moss.
The project is currently in early alpha,
and there will be many breaking changes ahead.

I'm an independent dev making this library to support [my other projects](http://www.ryanatkn.com/)
that focus on end-users.
I'm trying to make Moss the best CSS framework it can be
to enable advanced joy and utility for end-users.
To achieve this goal, I've been growing it slowly and methodically,
with regular breaking changes and experimental patterns.

I'm looking for collaborators to help Moss get to 1.0.
Programmers, designers, beginners, all are welcome -
Let's chat publicly about your ideas
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X),
or open [issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss) here on GitHub.

## Community

I run community spaces for my projects, including Moss,
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [Spiderspace](https://www.spiderspace.org/).

Please [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues) with any bugs
or other things you would like to discuss.
Prefer the Discord for most questions and discussions.

You can also find me as @webdevladder on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@webdevladder),
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@webdevladder),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdevladder),
and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=webdevladder).
I don't run any other communities like Reddit or Fediverse things
but don't let that stop you from making your own.

## Developers

If you feel comfortable looking at the source code,
Moss is ready to use in your own projects,
with the major caveat that there will be a lot of breaking changes ahead.
The code is significantly incomplete but I think it's stable enough to use
if you're willing to keep up with the relatively fast-moving changelog.
See the dev channels in [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues).

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes, but start with an issue for most PRs.

The code is permissively licensed, feel free to fork for your own needs.
