# Contributing to Moss

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to
[Moss](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss)
([moss.ryanatkn.com](https://moss.ryanatkn.com/)).
The project is currently in early alpha and
there will be many breaking changes ahead.

The guiding principles of Moss:

- build around CSS custom properties, primarily for runtime theming
- expose APIs to end-users for last-mile theming, customization, and content creation
- make the DX flexible and ergonomic

Moss differs from Tailwind in that it starts from CSS custom properties and uses them everywhere.
It also has more opinions than most frameworks,
but a goal is to let both developers and end-users shape it for their needs.

If this sounds interesting to you,
I'm welcoming help to iterate on APIs to get Moss to 1.0 and beyond.
Let's chat publicly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
or here in the [Github issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss).

I've been growing Moss slowly over 5+ years
to support [Zzz](https://zzz.ryanatkn.com/) and [my other projects](http://www.ryanatkn.com/)
that focus on end users, with regular breaking changes and experimental patterns.

## Community

I run community spaces for my projects, including Moss,
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [spiderspace.org](https://www.spiderspace.org/).

Please [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues) with any bugs
or other things you would like to discuss.
Prefer the Discord for most questions and discussions.

You can also find me as @webdevladder on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@webdevladder),
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@webdevladder),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdevladder),
and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=webdevladder).
I don't run any other communities like Reddit or Fediverse things
but don't let that stop you from making your own.

## Developers

If you feel comfortable looking at the source code,
Moss is ready to use in non-criticial and hobby projects,
with the major caveat that there will be a lot of breaking changes ahead.
The code is significantly incomplete but I think it's stable enough to use
if you're willing to keep up with the relatively fast-moving changelog.
Your feedback is welcome to help it improve.
See the dev channels in [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [Github issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues).

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes, but start with an issue for most PRs.

The code is permissively licensed, feel free to fork for your own needs.
