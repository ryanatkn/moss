# Contributing to Moss

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Moss.
The project is currently in early alpha.
There will be many breaking changes ahead,
and I'm welcoming help from people who would like to see it succeed.

I'm looking for collaborators to help Moss get to 1.0:
programmers, designers, beginner or w/e, all are welcome -
let's chat publicly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
or here in the [Github issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss).

I'm trying to make Moss the best CSS framework it can be
to enable advanced joy and utility for end-users.
It supports [my other projects](http://www.ryanatkn.com/) that focus on end-users.
Towards this goal, I've been growing Moss slowly and methodically over 5+ years,
with regular breaking changes and experimental patterns,
while using it in many different websites.

> Though I'm focused on the end-user, I also care a lot about DX,
> and have built tools like [Gro](https://github.com/ryanatkn/gro)
> to support a productive envionrment.

## Community

I run community spaces for my projects, including Moss,
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [Spiderspace](https://www.spiderspace.org/).

Please [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues) with any bugs
or other things you would like to discuss.
Prefer the Discord for most questions and discussions.

You can also find me as @webdevladder on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@webdevladder),
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@webdevladder),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdevladder),
and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=webdevladder).
I don't run any other communities like Reddit or Fediverse things
but don't let that stop you from making your own.

## Developers

If you feel comfortable looking at the source code,
Moss is ready to use in your own projects,
with the major caveat that there will be a lot of breaking changes ahead.
The code is significantly incomplete but I think it's stable enough to use
if you're willing to keep up with the relatively fast-moving changelog.
See the dev channels in [Discord](https://discord.gg/YU5tyeK72X)
and [Github issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/Moss/issues).

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes, but start with an issue for most PRs.

The code is permissively licensed, feel free to fork for your own needs.

## Funding
