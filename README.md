Moss is a CSS framework.
It's in early alpha and there will be many breaking changes.

Moss is being made to support [my other projects](https://www.ryanatkn.com/table)
that focus on end-users.
Moss emphasizes capability and efficiency and tries to be simple for those goals.
Compared to most UI libraries, Moss has fewer features and more opinions.

To learn more see [the docs](https://moss.ryanatkn.com/library) and [contributing.md](contributing.md).
Feel free to take the ideas and code for your own purposes.

The CSS framework:

- plain CSS
- designed around variables aka style variables aka design tokens,
  a specialization of [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
  - variables are a more primitive building block than classes
  - includes optional utility and semantic classes that use the variables
- the only required parts of the library are `@ryanatkn/moss/style.css` and either
  `@ryanatkn/moss/theme.css` or your own theme file, everything else can be used a la carte
- supports [`color-scheme` and custom themes](https://moss.ryanatkn.com/library/theme)
  (including dark mode)
- zero dependencies except for Svelte
- styles HTML tags directly, so you don't need to add `.btn` to buttons
  - encourages plain HTML elements like `button` and `a` over Svelte components
    unless the gains are substantial
- stylesheets:
  - [`@ryanatkn/style.css`](/src/lib/style.css), which is composed of:
    - [`@ryanatkn/style_reset.css`](/src/lib/style_reset.css) - required
    - [`@ryanatkn/style_utilities.css`](/src/lib/style_utilities.css) - optional
    - [`@ryanatkn/style_components.css`](/src/lib/style_components.css) - optional
    - [`@ryanatkn/style_animations.css`](/src/lib/style_animations.css) - optional
  - [`theme.css`](/src/lib/theme.css) - or bring your own
  - prefers Svelte's `<style>` for nontrivial cases
    because its utility classes are not nearly as featureful and complete as Tailwind -
    instead of providing a full interface to CSS through classes,
    Moss provides an arbitrary subset that defers to Svelte CSS for complex and uncommon patterns
    (advanced build tooling like a compiler could change this, but I have no current plans for that)
  - it probably makes sense to include a Vite plugin to remove unused styles,
    but the primary apps I'm building provide these styles to users
    and therefore won't remove unused code, so the feature isn't urgent
